    {
      "title": "What is Staking? Why should I stake?",
      "text": "Staking is the process of delegating, or locking up, cryptocurrency tokens to a validator. In return for locking up tokens, delegators receive staking rewards from the network."
    },
    {
      "title": "Are my tokens safe when I delegate to a validator?",
      "text": "Yes! Staking is a non-custodial service, which means the validator never has access to your funds or rewards."
    },
    {
      "title": "What is slashing, and does Vault Staking offer any protection from it?",
      "text": "Slashing is a penalty to a validator and its delegators when the validator misbehaves. Soft slashing is when a validator has continuous downtime, and is usually less than a 1% penalty. Hard slashing is when a validator double signs a block, and is usually between a 5% and 10% penalty. Vault Staking offers both soft and hard slashing refunds if our delegators lose funds due to a slashing penalty."
